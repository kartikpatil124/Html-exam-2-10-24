    <h3>Colossal Achievement for India | APL Raffles docks at Mundra Port, Gujarat</h3>
    <h5>a remarkable development for India’s maritime industry, Mundra Port, the flagship of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. (APSEZ), created a new record by welcoming the largest container ship ever to call at an Indian port. The vessel, MSC Anna, with an overall length of 399.98 meters—approximately the length of four football fields—and a remarkable capacity of 19,200 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), docked at Adani Ports, Mundra, on May 26. Announcing the details of the MSC Anna, Adani Ports and Logistics said in a statement released, "Its arrival draft is 16.3 m, which can be accommodated only at Adani Ports, Mundra, as no other port in India is capable of berthing a deep-draft vessel. During its stay, the expected exchange is 12,500 TEUs, underscoring Mundra Port’s capability to manage large cargo efficiently." Further, it is pertinent to note that today's achievement follows Mundra Port’s record in July 2023 when it berthed MV MSC Hamburg, one of the longest container ships in the world, measuring 399 meters in length and with a capacity of 16,652 TEUs. Significantly, Mundra’s record-breaking feats continued into the latter half of 2023.></h5>
